# Caroline Suorsa ePortfolio
## Professional Self-Assessment
Completing the coursework throughout the Computer Science program at SNHU and developing this ePortfolio has given me the opportunity to reflect on how far I have come as a learner, a problem solver, and an emerging software developer. Each course challenged me to think more critically, design more intentionally, and build solutions that are not only functional but maintainable, secure, and user‑centered.

Throughout the program, I have been able to practice skills such as collaborating in team environments, communicating with stakeholders, and adapting my work to meet the needs of different audiences. Through course work I was able to assume the roles of different members in a development team. This taught me how to break down complex tasks, coordinate responsibilities, and integrate multiple components into a cohesive final product. These classes also helped me learn how to translate technical concepts into clear, accessible language to communicate with stakeholders. 

Together, the artifacts in this portfolio demonstrate the full range of my abilities as a software developer. The first enhancement highlights my focus on user‑centered design and improving data reliability. The second showcases my understanding of algorithms and data structures through the implementation of sorting logic. The third demonstrates my ability to modify and extend a database system while applying secure and defensive programming practices. As I move forward in my career, I am confident that the skills I have developed will allow me to contribute meaningfully to the field.

## Course Outcomes

## Enhancement One - Software Design and Engineering
The artifact I chose for this enhancement is an Android event-tracker application that I made in CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming. I completed this project back in August 2025. The app allows users to log in, add events, and optionally receive SMS reminders. For this enhancement, I worked specifically on the AddEventActivity class.

I selected this artifact because it demonstrates my ability to analyze existing code, identify weaknesses, and implement meaningful improvements. The original version relied on manual text input for dates, which created reliability issues. By integrating a DatePicker, I improved the user experience, eliminated invalid date formats, and ensured consistent data storage. This enhancement showcases my skills in user‑centered design, refactoring, UI development, and applying standardized components to improve software quality.

This enhancement aligns with outcome 3 which focuses on designing and evaluating computing solutions using appropriate principles and managing trade‑offs, as well as outcome 4 which focuses on using well‑founded and innovative tools in computing practices. By replacing a fragile input method with a standardized DatePicker component, I demonstrated thoughtful design, improved reliability, and better alignment with industry standards. I do not need to update my outcome‑coverage plans, as this enhancement fully supports the goals I originally identified.

Enhancing this artifact taught me the importance of designing interfaces that guide users toward valid input rather than relying on error handling after the fact. I learned how to integrate Android UI components more effectively and how small design decisions can significantly improve both user experience and data quality. One challenge I faced was ensuring that the DatePicker interacted smoothly with the existing layout and database logic.

## Enhancement Two - Algorithms and Data Structures
The artifact I chose for this enhancement is an Android event-tracker application that I made in CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming. This is the same artifact I chose for my previous enhancement. For this enhancement, I worked specifically on the RecyclerViewAdapter class and the MainActivity class.

I selected this artifact because it demonstrates my ability to apply algorithmic reasoning and data structure manipulation to solve a practical problem. Sorting is a fundamental concept in and implementing it in a real application allowed me to show how theoretical knowledge translates into functional, user‑facing features. The enhancement showcases my ability to design a sorting solution, integrate it into an existing codebase, and ensure that it works seamlessly with the UI and database layers.

I met the course outcomes I planned to address. This enhancement aligns with outcome 3, which is focused on designing and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic principles, as well as outcome 4, which focuses on applying well‑founded techniques and tools in computing practices. By implementing a sorting algorithm and integrating it into the app’s data flow, I demonstrated my abilities in algorithmic efficiency, data consistency, and user‑centered functionality. This enhancement fully supports the goals I identified at the beginning of the course.

The original challenge I faced when I chose this enhancement was ensuring that the sorting logic worked consistently with the date format. This was addressed earlier through the DatePicker enhancement. When I began implementing the sorting feature, I used a manual nested‑loop algorithm, closely following the pseudocode I wrote for the enhancement. However, as I continued refining the feature, I realized that while the nested‑loop method worked, it wasn’t the most efficient or maintainable solution. This led me to transition to Java’s built‑in sort method with a Comparator. Making this switch taught me the importance of balancing algorithmic understanding with practical software engineering. The built‑in method is faster, cleaner, and easier to read, and it reduces the chance of introducing bugs through manual index manipulation.

## Enhancement Three - Databases
The artifact I chose for this enhancement is an Android event-tracker application that I made in CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming. This is the same artifact I chose for my two previous enhancements. For this enhancement, I updated the EventDatabase, Event, RecyclerViewAdapter, ViewHolder, and AddEventActivity classes. I also updated the event_list and add_event XML files.

I selected this artifact because it demonstrates my ability to work with persistent data storage, manage schema changes, and maintain data integrity across an entire application. These are essential skills for any software developer, especially when building applications that rely on structured data. The artifact was improved by expanding the database schema, updating all related components, and adding defensive programming techniques.

I met the outcomes I originally planned to address, outcomes 3 and 4 which related to designing and evaluating computing solutions and using well‑founded techniques and tools. However, I also achieved course outcome 5 which I did not originally expect to cover. By adding error handling to the database layer, I strengthened the app’s resilience against malformed queries, unexpected failures, and potential misuse. Because of this, I updated my outcome‑coverage plan to include this security‑focused outcome as well.

Enhancing this artifact taught me how deeply interconnected the database layer is with the rest of the application. Adding a new field required updates to the schema, the model class, the UI, and the adapter. This helped me understand the importance of maintaining consistency across all layers of an application and how a single change can ripple through the entire system. I also learned a great deal about secure and defensive programming. Implementing error handling made me think about how the database could fail and how to prevent those failures from crashing the app. This process helped me develop a stronger security mindset and a better appreciation for anticipating vulnerabilities before they occur. What was a little challenging was making sure I updated every class that accessed the database to include the new category.
